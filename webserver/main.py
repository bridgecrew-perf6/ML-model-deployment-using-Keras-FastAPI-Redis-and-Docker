Web server script that exposes endpoints and pushes images to Redis for classification by model server. Polls
Redis for response from model server.

Good to know:
Serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes to store the object 
or transmit it to memory, a database, or a file. 
Its main purpose is to save the state of an object in order to be able to recreate it when needed.
The reverse process is called deserialization.
